   ```

## Tool-specific Features and Usage

### 1. GPT Chat Advanced (gptchat)

A versatile chat interface with advanced file processing and image analysis capabilities.

#### Features:
- **Text extraction from URLs**: Fetch and process text content directly from web pages.
- **File reading and processing**: Supports a wide range of file formats including `txt`, `md`, `html`, `css`, `xml`, `pdf`, `xls`, `xlsx`, `csv`, `py`.
- **Bulk file reading**: Automatically process all supported files in a designated 'files' folder.
- **Image processing with OCR and GPT-4 Vision integration**: Analyze images and extract relevant information.
- **Custom bot creation with expertise and style**: Users can add special bots with custom expertise and communication styles. 
    GPT will automatically determine which bot should respond to the user's query based on the context.



#### Usage:
```
python gptchat.py
```

#### Special Commands:
- `/help`: Show help message
- `/exit`: Exit the script
- `/clear`: Clear conversation history and output files
- `/url [URL]`: Extract and process text from a given URL
- `/read [file path]`: Read and process a specific file
- `/image [image path]`: Process an image for analysis
- `/readfiles`: Read all supported files from the 'files' folder
- `/tr [text]`: Translate the given text
- `/add`: add user in bot lists
- `/list`: list all existing bots in file



### 2. GPT Python (gptpy)

A tool designed for generating, updating, and executing Python code snippets using GPT.

#### Features:
- Generate and execute Python code snippets based on user input
- Save and manage conversation histories
- Dynamic interaction with generated code, including running and capturing output

#### Usage:
```
python gptpy.py
```

#### Special Commands:
- `/help`: Show help message
- `/run`: Execute the last generated Python script
- `/clear`: Clear all records from the conversation and code output files
- `/read <file>`: Read and process the specified file's content
- `exit`: Exit the script


### 3. GPT for Linux Commands (gptshell)

A ChatBot specialized in providing expert-level Linux command suggestions and execution.

#### Features:
- Expert-level Linux command suggestions
- Concise command responses tailored to user queries
- Option to execute suggested commands with safety prompts
- Automatic inclusion of 'sudo' for commands requiring elevated permissions

#### Usage:
```
python gptshell.py
```

#### Special Commands:
- `/help`: Show help message
- `exit`: Exit the script

## Notes

- Ensure your OpenAI account has access to the GPT-4 model.
- Some features may require additional setup or dependencies (e.g., OCR capabilities for image processing).
- Use caution when executing suggested commands, especially those with 'sudo' privileges.
